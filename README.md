This is the auxiliary content for my CICM 2023 paper, "Multiple-inheritance hazards in dependently-typed algebraic hierarchies".

The corresponding slides can be found [at eric-wieser.github.io/cicm-2023](https://eric-wieser.github.io/cicm-2023).

Note that the gitpod setup does not quite work correctly, as it does not seem to be possible to have Lean 3 and Lean 4 running within the same workspace.
You will have to disable each extension in turn to try out code from the other.
